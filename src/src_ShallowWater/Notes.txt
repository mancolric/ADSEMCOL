Model 1: hyperbolic flux is convective + g, source term is -g*eta*nabla b
Model 2: hyperbolic flux is convective, source term is -g*h*nabla eta

-C-property: if Deltah=0, OK with both models. If Deltah>0, there is noise in q1 and q2. The noise behaves as TolS.

-Travelling vortex. With model 2, outlet is unstable (both for subsonic and supersonic outlet conditions).
